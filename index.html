        <h2>What is Computer Science?</h2>
        <p>
          According to the Department of Computer Science in the University of
          Maryland,"Computer science is the study of computers and computational
          systems, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software
          systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and
          application."
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover "Computer Science include artificial intelligence, computer
          systems and networks, security, database systems, human computer
          interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming
          languages, software engineering, bioinformatics and theory of
          computing."

        <h2>Why do you need to learn Computer Science?</h2>
        <p>
          The CSU Global mantions that "everywhere you look, you’ll find
          computers and other technological systems or devices powering business
          decisions and operations."
        </p>
        <p>
          They also added "It’s virtually impossible to run a modern business
          without utilizing computer-driven technology, which is just one of the
          many reasons why people consider computer science to be so important."

            Uncle Bob mentions in one of his lectures that our society runs on
            program and that there almost nothing that doesn't has to go though
            a program to be done.
          </p>
          <p>
            And he mentions that it is the computer scientists who do these
            programs so technically they are in control of what happens, and
            that shows how much the influence of the computer scientist is huge
            on our society
